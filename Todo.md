# This is a markdown file to serve as a list for what else I have to do

## 1. Implement logic:
- Create DateTimeHandler class that: **decodes/encodes date/time strings, calculate days function to calculate how many days left from current date.**
- JSON Encoder/Decoder

## 2. Optional if I get to it in time:
- Then inside edit view create more task properties for the json like:
    **Word highlighting, bold, italicized, colored etc**
- Light/dark themes
- Encrypting tasks.json so no other app or user without permission can access it

# Currently working on:
- Wrapping up base UI like implementing Selection/Edit View
- Fixing any bugs related to the UI navigation along with State management and adding if needed
