# This is a markdown file to serve as a list for what else I have to do

## 1. Implement Task functionality:
  - Create Task view to insert into TodoView ***so the user can see their tasks on the homescreen***
  - Create add task view
  - Manage loading in tasks from modelView and obviously create saving functionality
  - Create tasks.json
  - Create edit view to also edit an individual task

## 2. Fix InfoView state management:
  ### Specifically fix keeping arrows toggled by user throughout the apps lifetime
    ***And just fix data management in general like modelView saving and state          management***

## 3. Optional if I get to it in time:
- Then inside edit view create more task properties for the json like:
    **Word highlighting, bold, italicized, colored etc**
- Light/dark themes
- Encrypting tasks.json so no other app or user without permission can access it
